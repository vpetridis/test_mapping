# Searching Todos App

This is a React todo-app that I wanted to use with the <a href="https://fusejs.io/">Fuse.js</a> searching library. I really enjoyed making this one, because, although it seems simple, the responsiveness of the search, combined with the super fast animations, greets the user with a nice UX.

## Practice makes better

-   Implemented Fuse.js for the searching capabilities
-   Use Animate.css
-   Do some conditional rendering, just for fun
